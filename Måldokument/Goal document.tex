\section*{Background}
PerfectIT BeX AB has three products distributed as SaaS-solutions. The three products are:
\begin{itemize}
\item BeX Online - a cloud based ERP-system specialized for retail and e-commerce businesses. BeX Online has features for finance, sales orders, purchase orders, inventory/warehousing, business intelligence-reporting and more. 
\item BeX Retail - a desktop retail application connected to BeX Online.
\item BeX B2B - a cloud based system for order handling inbetween businesses.
\end{itemize}

BeX Online has a module for creating business intelligence reports (refered to as BI-reports) but generating what is considered as large reports is slow and puts a high demand on the system. The company believes that this process could be faster and more effective. 


\section*{Goal}
PerfectIt BeX AB wants the process behind generating these reports analyzed and optimised to improve the speed of the generation and lessen the demands it puts on the system.

\section*{Overall objectives and issues/research questions}
First the current processes behind generation of the BI-reports must be identified and mapped. This mapping will then be analyzed for bottle-necks and innefficiencies. Then research will be performed to learn of approaches to solve the problems identified in the analysis. The research will consider as much options as possible to maintain a stable solution for the system now and in the future.
These approaches will then be analyzed to decide which of them are a best fit and should be used to reach the goal. This will then be implemented in BeX Online and a final analysis should be performed to determine if the goal was met.
 It is also important that the new solution does not affect the users course of action for obtaining business intelligence.

\section*{Approach / Methodology and activities}
The nature of this thesis is problem solving. Because of this, the Action Research methodology will be used. The different activities in this methodology will be:

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{l p{14cm}}
 Steps & Activities \\ 
\\Plan & The company's employees will help with setting up a developing environment complete with a copy of a real database. Using this environment a mapping of the processes behind the producing of BI-reports will be made. \\ 
\\Do & Analyze this process to identify bottlenecks and innefficiencies. Research will be done to find relevant solutions to these problems. These solutions should then be applied to the system.\\
\\ Study & The new process of producing BI-reports should be verified and validated to determine if the goal was met.\\
\\ Learn & Using the results of this thesis more effective and better business intelligence data visualisation can be created. This is however out of scope for this thesis.
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section*{Research in the field}
This thesis's field is a thoroughly researched area and the resources available is almost infinite. Finding the right information and solution will therefore be crucial. The research will spread across different platforms, such as web based, articles, books, forums etc.  In the current state it's hard to point out the right resources, but some examples are given in the table below (The examples are links).
